Webistrano - Capistrano deployment the easy way
===============================================

About
-----

Webistrano is a Web UI for managing Capistrano deployments.
It lets you manage projects and their stages like test, production, and staging with different settings.
Those stages can then be deployed with Capistrano through Webistrano.

An extra feature to easily deploy Symfony2 projects was added, with the help of Capifony.


Installation
------------

### 1. Dependencies

Install all gem dependencies via the gem bundler:

```bash
> bundle install
```

### 2. Configuration

Copy `config/webistrano_config.rb.sample` to `config/webistrano_config.rb` and edit appropriatly.
In this configuration file you can set the mail settings of Webistrano.

### 3. Database

Copy `config/database.yml.sample` to `config/database.yml` and edit to resemble your setting.
You need at least the production database.
The others are optional entries for development and testing.

Then create the database structure with Rake:

```bash
> bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
```

### 4. Start Webistrano

```bash
> bundle exec thin -e production start
```

or (for development)

```bash
> sh start-dev.sh
```

Webistrano is then available at http://host:3000/

The default user is `admin`, the password is `admin`.
Please change the password after the first login.
